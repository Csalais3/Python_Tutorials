# Object Oriented Programming in Python

x = 1
print(type("Hello")) # Prints <Class 'str'>
print(type("Hello")) # Prints <Class 'int'>

# Our datatypes are objects that are type <datatype> with the value x (Everything in Python is an Object)

print(type(hello)) # Prints <Class 'function'>


# Common error messages
x = 1
y = "hello"
# print(x + y) # Because our object is an int, and our other object is a string, the program does not know how to respond to this
# Addition operation is not defined for objects of class int and objects of class string
